-same alg, same analysis
-can't create by accident other instances


-can't change during execution the alg
-can't pick from more


Bachelor topic-Kickstarter Projects Success Prediction
	My topic is predicting whether a projects will be able
	 to successfully raise the moneyit set out to raise in a certain time frame. 
	The bachelor thesis is 
	developed entirely in Jupyter Notebook using Python for algorithms
	and data visualisation. Since I did not develop any apps I had to create
	specific scenarios to do the assignment that do not match the reality
	of my project exactly.


Problem to be solved by pattern:
	The after the user introduces the project details, analysis phase starts, where 
	a single algorithm will be used to predict success. (in reality many algorithms 
	will be tested and adjusted, then the optimal and most reliable one will be used)
	
Advantages for the solution
	Singleton allows for an unique instance that can't be accidentally created again later
	Permits lazy initialization
	
Disadvanages
	May present unnecessary restrictions
	It can't be inherited from, so new functionalities can't be implemented in a descendant
