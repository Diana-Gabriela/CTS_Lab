Bachelor topic-Kickstarter Projects Success Prediction
	My topic is predicting whether a projects will be able
	 to successfully raise the moneyit set out to raise in a certain time frame. 
	The bachelor thesis is 
	developed entirely in Jupyter Notebook using Python for algorithms
	and data visualisation. Since I did not develop any apps I had to create
	specific scenarios to do the assignment that do not match the reality
	of my project exactly.


Problem to be solved by pattern:
	We want the users of the app to introduce their project data, and to create
	the instances based on that effectively. The base necessary information needed
	is a project name and goal, after that the users can add the other information.
	I have many attributes to be analysed besides the ones implemented
	(about 13 in total) but implementing everything is beyond the scope of the 
	assignment.
	
Advantages for the solution
	Builder allows for efficient data validation
	Builder creates instances that can't be modified later (so you can't chance
	category later for example, it would mess up the algorithm results)
	Easier to maintain for may fields and less error prone
	
Disadvanages
	May complicate dependency injection later
	The builder class must be mutable
